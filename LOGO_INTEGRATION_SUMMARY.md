# Logo Integration Summary

This document summarizes the progress made in applying your logo to different platforms in your Flutter project.

## Android - COMPLETED

The following Android launcher icons have been successfully updated:
- mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher.png (48x48) ← android-icon-48x48.png
- mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher.png (72x72) ← android-icon-72x72.png
- mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png (96x96) ← android-icon-96x96.png
- mipmap-xxhdpi/ic_launcher.png (144x144) ← android-icon-144x144.png
- mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher.png (192x192) ← android-icon-192x192.png

Note: The mipmap-ldpi directory was missing, so the 36x36 icon was not applied. If needed, you can create this directory and add the icon manually.

## iOS - PARTIALLY COMPLETED

The following iOS App Icons have been successfully updated:
- Icon-App-60x60@2x.png (120x120) ← apple-icon-120x120.png
- Icon-App-60x60@3x.png (180x180) ← apple-icon-180x180.png
- Icon-App-76x76@1x.png (76x76) ← apple-icon-76x76.png
- Icon-App-76x76@2x.png (152x152) ← apple-icon-152x152.png

The following iOS App Icons still need to be updated:
- Icon-App-20x20@1x.png (20x20)
- Icon-App-20x20@2x.png (40x40)
- Icon-App-20x20@3x.png (60x60)
- Icon-App-29x29@1x.png (29x29)
- Icon-App-29x29@2x.png (58x58)
- Icon-App-29x29@3x.png (87x87)
- Icon-App-40x40@1x.png (40x40)
- Icon-App-40x40@2x.png (80x80)
- Icon-App-40x40@3x.png (120x120) - Already covered by 60x60@2x
- Icon-App-83.5x83.5@2x.png (167x167)
- Icon-App-1024x1024@1x.png (1024x1024)

To complete the iOS integration, you'll need to either:
1. Generate the missing icon sizes from your original logo.png
2. Use image editing software to create the required sizes
3. Use the apple-icon.png file (which appears to be the largest available) and scale it to the required sizes

## Web - PARTIALLY COMPLETED

The following web icons have been successfully updated:
- web/icons/Icon-192.png (192x192) ← android-icon-192x192.png
- web/icons/Icon-maskable-192.png (192x192) ← android-icon-192x192.png

The following web icons still need to be updated:
- web/icons/Icon-512.png (512x512)
- web/icons/Icon-maskable-512.png (512x512)

Note: web/favicon.png has been updated with favicon-32x32.png

To complete the web integration, you'll need to:
1. Generate or obtain a 512x512 icon for the large icons
2. Choose an appropriate favicon size (16x16, 32x32, or 96x96) and copy it to web/favicon.png

## Next Steps

1. Generate the missing icon sizes for iOS and web platforms
2. Update the remaining icon files as listed above
3. Test your app on all target platforms to ensure the logos display correctly
4. Consider using an automated icon generation tool for future updates

## Tips for Generating Missing Icons

To generate the missing icon sizes, you can:
1. Use online tools like https://www.favicon-generator.org/ or https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. Use image editing software like GIMP (free) or Photoshop to resize your original logo.png
3. Use command-line tools like ImageMagick if available:
   ```bash
   # Example of resizing an image with ImageMagick
   convert logo.png -resize 1024x1024 ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/Icon-App-1024x1024@1x.png
   ```
4. For Flutter projects, consider using the `flutter_launcher_icons` package which can automatically generate all required icon sizes from a single image

After generating the missing icons, simply copy them to their respective locations as indicated in the "still need to be updated" sections above.
